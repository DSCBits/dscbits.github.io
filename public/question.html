    You are a bold one. You successfully restarted the backup engine and were able to thrust back the craft away from
    the CXP10 black hole thus saving yourself from spaghettification and instant death. But one challenge solved means
    the other is just around the corner. Now your craft is floating in the deep space with no one manoeuvring it at the
    moment. The auto-pilot system has been fried, and lasted navigation system is a bust. Only radio telescope works,
    but it can't clearly distinguish between space and objects not emitting light. It only shows a white screen even
    though it has all the data to identify the objects. Now tinker your way through to find out how to navigate using
    this date.
