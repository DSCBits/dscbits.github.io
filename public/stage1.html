        You see your death in front of you, you're scared, well anyone would be in this situation. But you, you have a calm
        mind. There is a backup engine that can only be used in times of despair. You recall this from your training. But
        you don't know the password to activate it, yet. Its password is highly encrypted so that alien species in outer
        space cannot highjack your spacecraft. Now, you have the task of figuring it out.
