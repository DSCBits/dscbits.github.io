    Something's happening. Your backup engine started throttling and was able to thrust back the craft away from the
    CXP10 black hole thus saving yourself from spaghettification and instant death. But your craft is floating in the
    deep space with no one manoeuvring it at the moment. The auto-pilot system has been fried, and you are lost in deep
    space! Can you find your way out?
